## Massachusetts General Hospital Performance Dashboard

### Project Overview
This project is part of the Maven Hospital Challenge, aimed at building an interactive executive dashboard for Massachusetts General Hospital. The dashboard provides a high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) to help stakeholders gain valuable insights into various aspects of hospital operations.

### Key Features
- 📊 **Patient Encounters & Readmission Rates**: Track patient encounters, total patients, readmission rates, and more.
- 💰 **Cost Analysis**: Analyze average cost per visit by demographics, procedures, and insurance payers.
- 🏥 **Admissions & Procedures**: Visualize covered procedures by admission type, year, age group, gender, and ethnicity.
- 🖱️ **Interactive Elements**: Each KPI includes clickable buttons for deeper analysis. Bookmarks and selection features are used to create an engaging and interactive user experience.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is provided by the Maven Hospital Challenge and contains information on patient admissions, procedures, costs, and insurance coverage. 

### Key Questions Answered
- 📈 How many patients have been admitted or readmitted over time?
- ⏳ How long are patients staying in the hospital, on average (calculated by removing 13 outliers)?
- 💲 How much is the average cost per visit?
- 📝 How many procedures are covered by insurance?

### Insights
- 👥 **Patient Encounters**: The total patient encounters and readmission rates provide a clear picture of patient inflow and hospital utilization.
- 💸 **Cost Distribution**: The average cost per visit varies significantly by age, ethnicity, and procedure type, highlighting areas for potential cost management.
- 🏦 **Insurance Coverage**: Most procedures are covered by Medicare, indicating the importance of managing relationships with major insurers.
- 📅 **Readmission Trends**: The readmission rates by time and type of admission reveal critical periods and types for intervention to reduce readmission.

### Recommendations
- 🔄 **Reduce Readmission Rates**: Focus on improving discharge planning and follow-up care, especially for high-readmission procedures.
- 💡 **Cost Management**: Implement cost-control measures for high-cost procedures and explore alternative treatment options that provide similar outcomes at lower costs.
- 🌟 **Patient Experience**: Enhance patient experience and care coordination for demographic groups with higher costs and readmission rates to improve overall outcomes.
- 🤝 **Insurance Partnerships**: Strengthen partnerships with major insurers like Medicare to ensure continued coverage and potentially negotiate better terms for high-volume procedures.
